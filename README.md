# Assignment 1  
This repository contains solutions for two tasks from Module 2: Basic Python Concepts. The program is written in two Python files, Task 1 and Task 2.

## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations  
The program prompts the user to enter two numbers, then performs and displays the results of the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Division by zero is handled appropriately to prevent runtime errors.

### Sample Input/Output  
```sh
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5
  
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15  
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5  
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50  
Divisiont: 10 / 5 = 2.0
```

## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting  
The program asks the user for their first and last name, concatenates them into a full name, and prints a personalized greeting message.

### Sample Input/Output  
```sh
Enter your first name: John  
Enter your last name: Doe
 
Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the python program.
```
